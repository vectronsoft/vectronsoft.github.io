    <p>Each type of enemy has an english word ranging from 3-6 letters in length. The letters are shuffled randomly.</p>
    
    <p>For example <i>happy</i> is shown as <i>hpapy</i></p>

    <p>

    <p>Pressing "h" results:</p>
    
    <p><span style="color:#3498DB">h</span>papy</p>
    
    <p>Pressing "a" results:</p>
    
    <p><span style="color:#3498DB">ha</span>ppy</p>
    
    <p>In this case you only needed to enter "ha" since the rest of the word was already matching.</p>
    
    <p>Enemies with shorter words are usually faster.</p>
