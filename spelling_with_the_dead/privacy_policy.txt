Data collected and shared automatically

The Google Mobile Ads SDK collects and shares the following data types automatically for advertising, analytics, and fraud prevention purposes.

Data	By default, the Google Mobile Ads SDK...

* IP address	Collects device's IP address, which may be used to estimate the general location of a device.
* User product interactions	Collects user product interactions and interaction information, including app launch, taps, and video views.
* Diagnostic information	Collects information related to the performance of your app and the SDK, including crash logs, app launch time, hang rate, and energy usage.
* Device and Account identifiers	Collects Android advertising (ad) ID, app set ID, and, if applicable, other identifiers related to signed-in accounts on the device.
* All of the user data collected by Google Mobile Ads SDK is encrypted in transit using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

Data handling
* Android ad ID collection is optional. The ad ID can be reset or deleted by users using ad ID controls in the Android settings menu. As the app developer, you can prevent the collection of ad IDs by updating the app's manifest file.

Certain other features in the Google Mobile Ads SDK, such as the Limited Ads feature, may also disable transmission of the ad ID and other data.
